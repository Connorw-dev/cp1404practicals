# CP1404 Practicals
This repository contains my practical work for the subject CP1404 - Programming 2 at James Cook University.
## What is clean code?
Some lessons I've learnt about clean code in CP1404 are:
- Well formatted to PEP8 standards
- Very functional, but not too functional
- Imperative, concise docstrings and comments
